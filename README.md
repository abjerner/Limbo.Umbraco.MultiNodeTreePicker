# Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker

**Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker** adds a special multinode treepicker to the Umbraco 8 backoffice in which developers can select a custom item converter.

The purpose of an item converter is to control the C# type returned by the `.Value()` method or the corresponding property in a ModelsBuilder generated model. This is particular useful in a SPA/Headless Umbraco implementation, where the ModelsBuilder model can then be returned directly via a WebAPI endpoint.

## Installation

**Install via NuGet**  
This is the recommended approach, as you install the [**NuGet Package**][NuGetPackage] in your Visual Studio project, and NuGet takes care of the rest.

```
Install-Package Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker -pre
```
**Umbraco package**  
Download the package from Our Umbraco - the Umbraco cummunity website:

## Examples

At @skybrud we typically use Umbraco as a headless CMS, and being able to control the generated models therefore makes a lot of sense. If a given page has some related content, it doesn't make sense for us to return the full model of a related model, so we instead have an item class with the needed properties - this class could be called `TestItem`.

Normally the property with the related content would return the full model for each page, but with the special multinode treepicker from this package, we can implement a custom item converter.

We can do this by implementing the [`IMntpItemConverter`](https://github.com/abjerner/Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker/blob/master/src/Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker/Converters/IMntpItemConverter.cs) interface, but do get going a bit quicker, the package also contains the abstract [`MntpGenericItemConverter`](https://github.com/abjerner/Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker/blob/master/src/Skybrud.Umbraco.MultiNodeTreePicker/Converters/MntpGenericItemConverter.cs) class we can use instead:

```csharp
public class TestMntpItemConverter : MntpGenericItemConverter<TestItem> {

    public TestMntpItemConverter() : base("Default item converter", x => new TestItem(x)) { }

}
```

```csharp
public class TestItem {
        
        public Guid Key { get; }

        public string Name { get; }

        public string Url { get; }
        
        public TestItem(IPublishedContent content) {
            Key = content.Key;
            Name = content.Name;
            Url = content.Url;
        }

    }
```

The `MntpGenericItemConverter` class requires us to specify a name for the converter, and then a callack function that will be used for convertering each `IPublishedContent` to the desired type.

When the data type is confiured to use our item converter (see screenshot above), properties of this type will now return `List<TestItem>` instead of `List<IPublishedContent>`.

With this special multinode treepicker, it's the datatype of the individual property, that determines the returned value. Another property could for instance be for selecting contact persons where we'd need a bit more information that what's available from the `TestItem` class, so we can create another item converter:

```csharp
  public class TestMntpPersonItemConverter : MntpGenericItemConverter<TestPersonItem> {

      public TestMntpPersonItemConverter() : base("Person item converter", x => new TestPersonItem(x)) { }

  }
```

```csharp
  public class TestPersonItem : TestItem {

      public string Phone { get; }

      public string Email { get; }

      public TestPersonItem(IPublishedContent content) : base(content) {
          Phone = content.Value<string>("phone");
          Email = content.Value<string>("email");
      }

  }
```

## Inspiration

The item converters in this package was inspired by a similar concept in the [Contentment](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment) package. Thanks for creating and sharing this with us @leekelleher üëç
